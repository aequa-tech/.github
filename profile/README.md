### Our Mission: Fighting Misinformation

In [aequa-tech](https://aequa-tech.com/) we believe that fighting misinformation is a crucial step to build better societies. Therefore we developed a tool that supports citizens in the identification and understanding of news that conveys false or otherwise problematic contents. Debunker-Assistant is developed for and with the communities of professionals and organizations who fight misinformation,

### The Community Edition of Debunker-Assistant
Debunker-Assistant is an Open Source and it always will be. We and [weLaika](https://dev.welaika.com/) maintain 5 repositories that represents the building blocks of our system

* [**Debunker-Assistant APIs:**](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) a set of Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis methods for the multidimensional analysis of the quality of news (that will soon become a library) 
* [**The Web Application:**](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) an application that allows users to create an account and have access to our system through a graphical interface
* [**The Annotation Platform:**](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) a module that allows users to provide feedback and annotations about misinformative contents.

### From *Future* Import De-Escalate
Debunker-Assistant is now in beta but our journey is just begun. Our next objective is to develop **De-Escalate** a technology that is able to (i) identify news that provokes polarization among citizens and (ii) help them understand opposite perspectives in order to foster mutual dialogue between polarized communities.

### Debunker Ecosystem
Debunker-Assistant is part of a network of partners and stakeholders that are essential to fulfill our mission. We would never been able to develop the first version of our technology without the NGI-Search Initiative who funded our project with 150,000 euros and supported our work with its group of experts in Open Source, Business Modelling, Open Data, etc. We take care of the AI stuff, **weLaika takes** care of the rest of the service. [Futura](https://www.futura.legal/) is our legal partner: they are not only the ones that wrote our terms and conditions but also a crucial support to design a product that embraces the principles of the EU market. Our product would not exist without a community of activists and NGOs. During our journey we met activists from [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.it/entra-in-azione/task-force-attivismo/) and [Hate Trackers](https://www.hate-trackers.com/beyondborders/) who help us trace the path of our techology.
