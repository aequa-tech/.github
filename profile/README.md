### Our Mission: Fighting Misinformation

Howdy, this is the organization page of Debunker-Assistant: our AI-enhanced tool for fake news detection. In [aequa-tech](https://aequa-tech.com/) we believe that fighting misinformation is a crucial step to build better societies. Therefore we developed a tool that supports citizens in the identification and understanding of news that conveys false or otherwise problematic contents. Debunker-Assistant is developed for and with the communities of professionals and organizations who fight misinformation, its community version is Open Source and it always will be.

### The Community Edition of Debunker-Assistant
Debunker-Assistant is an Open Source and it always will be. We and [weLaika](https://dev.welaika.com/) maintain 5 repositories that represents the building blocks of our system

* [**Debunker-Assistant APIs:**](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) a set of Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis methods for the multidimensional analysis of the quality of news (that will soon become a library) 
* [**The Web Application:**](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) an application that allows users to create an account and have access to our system through a graphical interface
* [**The Annotation Platform: **](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) a module that allows users to provide feedback and annotations about misinformative contents.

### A Glimps of the future. Debunker-Assistant: De-Escalate
Debunker-Assistant is now in beta but our journey is just begun. Our next objective is to develop a technology that is able to (i) identify news that provokes polarization among citizens and (ii) help them understand opposite perspectives in order to foster mutual dialogue between polarized communities.
