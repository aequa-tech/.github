### Our Mission: Fighting Misinformation

In [aequa-tech](https://aequa-tech.com/) we believe that fighting misinformation is a crucial step to build better societies. Therefore we developed a tool that supports citizens in the identification and understanding of news that conveys false or otherwise problematic contents. Debunker-Assistant is developed for and with the communities of professionals and organizations who fight misinformation,

### The Community Edition of Debunker-Assistant
Debunker-Assistant is an Open Source and it always will be. We and [weLaika](https://dev.welaika.com/) maintain 5 repositories that represents the building blocks of our system

* [**Debunker-Assistant APIs:**](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) a set of Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis methods for the multidimensional analysis of the quality of news (that will soon become a library) 
* [**The Web Application:**](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) an application that allows users to create an account and have access to our system through a graphical interface
* [**The Annotation Platform:**](https://github.com/aequa-tech/debunker-assistant) a module that allows users to provide feedback and annotations about misinformative contents.

### From *Future* Import De-Escalate
Debunker-Assistant is now in beta but our journey is just begun. Our next objective is to develop **De-Escalate** a technology that is able to (i) identify news that provokes polarization among citizens and (ii) help them understand opposite perspectives in order to foster mutual dialogue between polarized communities.

### Our Network
Debunker-Assistant is part of a network of partners and stakeholders that are essential to fulfill our mission. We take care of the AI stuff, **weLaika takes** care of the rest of the service. [Futura](https://www.futura.legal/) is our legal partner: they are not only the ones that wrote our terms and conditions but also a crucial support to design a product that embraces the principles of the EU market. Our product would not exist without a community of activists and NGOs. During our journey we met activists from [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.it/entra-in-azione/task-force-attivismo/) and [Hate Trackers](https://www.hate-trackers.com/beyondborders/) who help us trace the path of our techology.
